# Harley

The Harley is in a sad state.
It probably hasn't been running for nearly a year if not slightly longer.
I took the oil tank off to de-rust and paint it, which I finally did.
Some of the tubing that connects the oil tank had to be cut,
so I need to measure the inner diameter of the tubes with my calipers
and buy some new tubing.
I will also need new oil, though I have primary oil from the last change.
The battery is also currently in the basement.
I have periodically pluged the battery into a tender,
but it is definitely time I did so again.

I would like to complete this by early riding season 2023.
As soon as I submit my paper,
this should be top priority. 
Then I can use it to camp, travel, and commute.
I can also finally sell the Yamaha.

Replaced the oil tank and primary and engine oil. 
It did require buying some hose from O'Reilly.
Got it running!!! 

The battery died while it was parked in the Metro garage on 5/20/24.
Bump started 5/22 down garage ramp in 2nd gear and rode to Jefferson and Park before it died at the light.
Tried to bump start on slope W of Park, but couldn't quite get enough speed.
Rented a motorcycle trailer from U-Haul and towed with Baja on 5/23.
Need to remove, test, and likely replace battery.

# Yamaha

I really would like to sell the Yamaha.
It is currently missing the plastic panel that is covers the tool kit.
I should replace that, clean everything up, and post it on Craigslist.
I think a starting price of $1,500 or $2,000 would be good.

Have an interested buyer! Just need to wash and photograph.
Can try to sell as-is.

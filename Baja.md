# Subaru Baja Maintenance and Mods

We bought a Subaru Baja!!!
It is the 5-speed manual non-turbo skew.
This is a log of all the maintenance that I have performed on it so far with plans for future work!

## Maintenance log

### AC

**5/26/24** 
Replaced o-rings for high and low pressure lines with AC Master o-rings from O'Reilly's. 
Used YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6tI7CyztE) to identify likely issue and location of lines.
10 mm bolts hold lines on.
Used small flat-head driver to pick old o-rings off.
Did not have PAG for lube, so used a small volume of motorcycle fork oil to pre-lube new o-rings.
Size matched inner diameter and did best to size match thickness to OEM o-rings.
Plan to store used o-rings in maintenance box in labelled envelope.
Old o-rings were squared-off, but were otherwise still elastic and supple.

Recharged AC system with Big Chill R-134a with leak sealer. 
Used full bottle (22 Oz) made for truck/suv and got to the 30 mark in green on the guage. 
Guage is re-usable. 

AC works!!! Still works as of 5/28!!!

### Stereo receiver

**5/26-5/27/24**
Installed JVC KD-X280BT from Crutchfield.
Soldered harness adapter according to manufacturer's instructions.
[Video of removal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5pGF7TQJeQ)
Removed shifter boot plate - only held on by tabs.
Removed ash-tray.
Removed two long screws holding in change tray and removed tray.
Revomed two short screws holding in ash tray receiver - really hard to reach under front panel.
Removed front panelling - only tabs left.
2 screws on either side of AC/radio control panel (requires long phillips head driver) and 2 on bottom.
One screw from L side fell and was lost forever during reassembly.
Replaced receiver using Crutchfield screws and Baja mounting system - required removing border of JVC receiver to recess appropriately.
Plugged-in radio, microphone (ran to phone mount on center driver-side vent), and wiring adapter.
Re-assembled!
Everything works great!!!

Old reciever also worked great - try to sell on ebay!

### Power Steering

**5/27/24**
Horrible power steering squeek when purchased.
After dealership maintenance, fixed for about 1 week but came back. 
Worse at start up and when still.
Power steering fluid (ATF) level was low.
Suspect [old o-rings or cracked hose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNt2a4_3QH4) allow air in and that shop did not properly prime lines to refill level.

Replaced 2 o-rings for power steering fluid return line at the power steering pump with AC Master o-rings from O'Reilly's. 
Size matched inner diameter and did best to size match thickness to OEM o-rings.
Used ATF (Premium from O'Reilly) as lube for o-rings.
Plan to store used o-rings in maintenance box in labelled envelope.
Old o-rings were squared-off, but were otherwise still elastic and supple.

Released tension on belt sheild attached to return line outlet at pump so that it isn't pulling on connection.
YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ifANBSb8DA).

Topped off power steering fluid with ATF (Premium from O'Reilly).
Primed by turning wheel back and forth a bunch. 
No squeal when finished.
Drove to airport and back with no change in fluid level or squeal.

If squeal returns, likely need to replace hose and connection with reservoir. 


## Future upgrades

### Necessary

**Brakes**
Purchased replacement front and rear ceramic pads from A1 Auto.
Car currently has brake squeek when not engaged.
Rotors look relatively clean with no visable pitting.
Hopefully replacing pads will fix!
Likely also need a bleed and top-off of fluid.
I think it is DOT-3.

### Nice 

**Interior**
Front panelling had skew in limitted edition legacy/outback models with cup holder on passenger side.
I want to install this in the future to avoid cups in arm space required to shift.

**Engine**
Install H6 with stand-alone ECU.

**Suspension**
Install [Tacoma suspension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDsoUpStptg) in back to lift and increase haul capacity.
Lift front to match.

# How I plan to use Vimwiki

I have a terrible habbit of taking on a thousand hobbies and not documenting my learning process.
Vimwiki seems like a neat and efficient way to document the learning process of my hobbies.
I also plan to try using it as a daily TODO list to help me keep track of what my hobby and work priorities are throughout the day.


# What I need to know

Basically, since I already use markdown,
I just need to know the Vimwiki specific commands for opening/creating a new page,
navigating between pages, 
using the TODO list functionality,
and embedding links and maybe other data.

- Going to index <leader><ww>
- Opening/creating a new page: <enter>
- Delete wiki page (in case you made one on the wrong word): <leader><wd>
- Going to previous page: <backspace>
- Toggling on a todo list box on or off: <control & space>
- Marking todo list items as closer to completion: <gln>
- Toggling todo list items as less complete: <glp>

# Future direction

It would be cool to write a script that converts this markdown into
Gemini markdown.
Then I could use this wiki as the basis for making new Gemini posts.
